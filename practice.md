#This file is a practice run in how to type a markdown document.
=======================================

I was feeling `left-out` with all the **recent** advances on computer software and/or applcation for *statistics*.

This week I **accomplished** several minor task.  For instance:

		Download git
		Sign up for github
		learn command lines for git
		
		
The website for [github](https://github.com)

##The next step is learning the R statistical package.

I installed R studio for help learning R.  But still have no idea how to use it until I start coursera R course next month.
